        "body": "v32 of ScanCode is all about improved license detections!\r\n\r\nWe have more licenses and rules, and major updates on post-processing matches to license detections.\r\nWe also have major improvements in package license detections and unknown references, along with top level detection\r\nsummaries for licenses, and reference data for the licenses detected too. There are also a couple of API changes due to\r\nmodel changes in license data.\r\n\r\nSee also https://github.com/nexB/scancode.io/ for a complete, customizable SCA solution using ScanCode and\r\nhttps://github.com/nexB/scancode-workbench/releases for visualizing data generated by ScanCode Toolkit.\r\n\r\n# Important API changes:\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a major release with major API and output format changes and significant\r\nfeature updates.\r\n\r\nIn particular the output format has changed for the licenses and packages, and\r\nalso for some of the command line options.\r\n\r\nThe output format version is now 3.0.0.\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/milestone/15 for more details on this release.\r\nVisit https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/discussions/3406 to discuss about this release.\r\n\r\n## Package detection:\r\n\r\n- Update ``GemfileLockParser`` to track the gem which the Gemfile.lock is for,\r\n  which we assign to the new ``GemfileLockParser.primary_gem`` field. Update\r\n  ``GemfileLockHandler.parse()`` to handle the case where there is a primary gem\r\n  detected from a gemfile.lock. If there is a primary gem, a single ``Package``\r\n  is created and the detected gem data within the gemfile.lock are assigned as\r\n  dependencies. If there is no primary gem, then all of the dependencies are\r\n  collected into Package with no name and yielded.\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3072\r\n\r\n- Fix issue where dependencies were not reported when scanning an extracted\r\n  Python project by modifying ``BaseExtractedPythonLayout.assemble()`` to favor\r\n  using package data from a PKG-INFO file from an egg-info directory. Package\r\n  data from a PKG-INFO file from an egg-info directory contains the dependency\r\n  information collected from the requirements.txt file along side PKG-INFO.\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3083\r\n\r\n- Fix issue where we were returning incorrect purl package ``type`` for cocoapods.\r\n  ``pods`` was being returned  as a purl type for cocoapods, it should be\r\n  ``cocoapods`` instead.\r\n  https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-TYPES.rst#cocoapods\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3081\r\n\r\n- Code for parsing a Maven POM, npm package.json, freebsd manifest and haxelib\r\n  JSON have been separated into two functions: one that creates a PackageData\r\n  object from the parsed Resource, and another that calls the previous function\r\n  and yields the PackageData. This was done such that we can use the package\r\n  manifest data parsing code outside of the scancode-toolkit context in other\r\n  libraries.\r\n\r\n- The PackageData model now includes a ``holder`` field, which is populated with\r\n  holder data extracted from the copyright field if copyright data is present,\r\n  otherwise it remains empty.\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3290\r\n\r\n- DatafileHandlers now have a classmethod named ``get_top_level_resources()``,\r\n  which is supposed to yield the top-level Resources of a Package codebase,\r\n  relative to a Package manifest file. ``maven.MavenPomXmlHandler`` is the first\r\n  DatafileHandler that has this method implemented.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License detection:\r\n\r\n- The SPDX license list has been updated to the latest v3.20\r\n\r\n- This is a major update to license detection where we now combine one or more\r\n  license matches in a larger license detection. This approach improves the\r\n  accuracy of license detection and removes a larger number of false positive\r\n  or ambiguous license detections. See for details\r\n  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/2878\r\n\r\n- There is a new ``license_detections`` codebase level attribute with all the\r\n  unique license detections in the whole scan, both in resources and packages.\r\n  This has the 3 attributes also present in package/resource level license\r\n  detections: ``license_expression``, ``identifier`` and ``detection_log``\r\n  (present optionally if the ``--license-diagnostics`` option is enabled) with\r\n  an additional attribute:\r\n\r\n  - ``count``: Number of times in the codebase this unique license detection\r\n    was encountered.\r\n\r\n- The data structure of the JSON output has changed for licenses at file level:\r\n\r\n  - The ``licenses`` attribute is deleted.\r\n\r\n  - A new ``license_detections`` attribute contains license detections in that file.\r\n    This object has three attributes: ``license_expression``, ``identifier``\r\n    and ``matches``. ``matches`` is a list of license matches and is roughly\r\n    the same as  ``licenses`` in the previous version with additional structure\r\n    changes detailed below. Identifier is the detected license-expression with an\r\n    UUID generated from the content of ``matches`` such that this is unique for\r\n    unique detections. We also have another attribute ``detection_log`` with\r\n    diagnostics information if the ``--license-diagnostics`` option is enabled.\r\n\r\n  - A new attribute ``license_clues`` contains license matches with the\r\n    same data structure as the ``matches`` attribute in ``license_detections``.\r\n    This contains license matches that are mere clues and where not considered\r\n    to be a proper conclusive license detection.\r\n\r\n  - The ``license_expressions`` list of license expressions is deleted and\r\n    replaced by a ``detected_license_expression`` single expression.\r\n    Similarly ``spdx_license_expressions`` was removed and replaced by\r\n    ``detected_license_expression_spdx``.\r\n\r\n  - See `license updates documentation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/license-detection-reference.html#change-in-license-data-format-resource>`_\r\n    for examples and details.\r\n\r\n- The data structure of license attributes in ``package_data`` and the codebase\r\n  level ``packages`` has been updated accordingly:\r\n\r\n  - There is a new ``license_detections`` attribute for the primary, top-level\r\n    declared licenses of a package and an ``other_license_detections`` attribute\r\n    for the other secondary detections.\r\n\r\n  - The ``license_expression`` is replaced by the ``declared_license_expression``\r\n    and ``other_license_expression`` attributes with their SPDX counterparts\r\n    ``declared_license_expression_spdx`` and ``other_license_expression_spdx``.\r\n    These expressions are parallel to detections.\r\n\r\n  - The ``declared_license`` attribute is renamed ``extracted_license_statement``\r\n    and is now a YAML-encoded string, which can be parsed to recreate the\r\n    original extracted license statement. Previously this used to be nested\r\n    python objects lists/dicts/string, but now this is always a YAML string.\r\n\r\n    See `license updates documentation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/license-detection-reference.html#change-in-license-data-format-package>`_\r\n    for examples and details.\r\n\r\n- The license matches structure has changed: we used to report one match for each\r\n  license ``key`` of a matched license expression. We now report instead one\r\n  single match for each matched license expression, and list the license keys\r\n  as a ``licenses`` attribute. This avoids data duplication.\r\n  Inside each match, we list each match and matched rule attributred directly\r\n  avoiding nesting. See `license updates doc <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/license-detection-reference.html#licensematch-result-data>`_\r\n  for examples and details.\r\n\r\n- There are new and codebase level attributes with ``--license-references`` to report\r\n  reference license metadata and texts once for each license matched across the\r\n  scan; we now have two codebase level attributes: ``license_references`` and\r\n  ``license_rule_references`` that list unique detected license and license rules.\r\n  for examples and details. This reference data is also removed from license matches\r\n  in all levels i.e. from codebase, package and resource level license detections and\r\n  resource level license clues, irrespective of this CLI option being used, i.e. default\r\n  with ``--licenses``.\r\n  See `license updates documentation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/license-detection-reference.html#comparision-before-after-license-references>`_\r\n\r\n- We replaced the ``scancode --reindex-licenses`` command line option with a\r\n  new separate command named ``scancode-reindex-licenses``.\r\n\r\n  - The ``--reindex-licenses-for-all-languages`` CLI option is also moved to\r\n    the ``scancode-reindex-licenses`` command as an option ``--all-languages``.\r\n\r\n  - We can now detect licenses using custom license texts and license rules\r\n    stored in a directory or packaged as a plugin for consistent reuse and deployment.\r\n\r\n  - There is an ``--additional-directory`` option with the ``scancode-reindex-licenses``\r\n    command to add the licenses from a directory.\r\n\r\n  - There is also a ``--only-builtin`` option to use ony builtin licenses\r\n    ignoring any additional license plugins.\r\n\r\n  - See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/480 for more details.\r\n\r\n- We combined the license data file and text file of each license in a single\r\n  file with a .LICENSE extension. The .yml data file is now included at the\r\n  top of each .LICENSE file as \"YAML frontmatter\". The same applies to license\r\n  rules and their .RULE and .yml files. This halves the number of data files\r\n  from about 60,000 to 30,000. Git line history is preserved for the combined\r\n   text + yml files.\r\n\r\n  - See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3049\r\n\r\n- There is a new console script ``scancode-license-data`` to export\r\n  license data in JSON, YAML and HTML, with indexes and a static website for use\r\n  in the licensedb web site. This becomes the  API way to getr scancode license\r\n  data.\r\n\r\n  See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/2738\r\n\r\n- The deprecated \"--is-license-text\" option has been removed.\r\n  This is now built-in with the --license-text option and --info\r\n  and exposed with the \"percentage_of_license_text\" attribute.\r\n\r\n- The license dump() has been modified to add an extra space at empty\r\n  newlines for license files which also have multiple indentation levels\r\n  as this was generating invalid YAML output files when ``--license-text``\r\n  or ``--license-references`` was enabled.\r\n\r\n  See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3219\r\n\r\n- A bugfix has been added to the ``--unknown-licenses`` option where\r\n  we would crash when using this option without using ``--matched-text``\r\n  option. This is now working correctly and also better tested.\r\n\r\n  See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3343\r\n\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Add support for external licenses in scans by

        "body": "This is a major new release with API breaking changes.\r\nv32.0.0rc1 is the first release candidate and we expect to have a few more.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Important API changes:\r\n\r\nThis is a major release with major API and output format changes and significant\r\nfeature updates.\r\n\r\nIn particular changed to the output format for the licenses and packages, and\r\nwe changed some of the command line options.\r\n\r\nThe output format version is now 3.0.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Package detection:\r\n\r\n- Update ``GemfileLockParser`` to track the gem which the Gemfile.lock is for,\r\n  which we assign to the new ``GemfileLockParser.primary_gem`` field. Update\r\n  ``GemfileLockHandler.parse()`` to handle the case where there is a primary gem\r\n  detected from a gemfile.lock. If there is a primary gem, a single ``Package``\r\n  is created and the detected gem data within the gemfile.lock are assigned as\r\n  dependencies. If there is no primary gem, then all of the dependencies are\r\n  collected into Package with no name and yielded.\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3072\r\n\r\n- Fix issue where dependencies were not reported when scanning an extracted\r\n  Python project by modifying ``BaseExtractedPythonLayout.assemble()`` to favor\r\n  using package data from a PKG-INFO file from an egg-info directory. Package\r\n  data from a PKG-INFO file from an egg-info directory contains the dependency\r\n  information collected from the requirements.txt file along side PKG-INFO.\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3083\r\n\r\n- Fix issue where we were returning incorrect purl package ``type`` for cocoapods.\r\n  ``pods`` was being returned  as a purl type for cocoapods, it should be\r\n  ``cocoapods`` instead.\r\n  https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/master/PURL-TYPES.rst#cocoapods\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3081\r\n\r\n- Code for parsing a Maven POM, npm package.json, freebsd manifest and haxelib\r\n  JSON have been separated into two functions: one that creates a PackageData\r\n  object from the parsed Resource, and another that calls the previous function\r\n  and yields the PackageData. This was done such that we can use the package\r\n  manifest data parsing code outside of the scancode-toolkit context in other\r\n  libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License detection:\r\n\r\n- The SPDX license list has been updated to the latest v3.19\r\n\r\n- This is a major update to license detection where we now combine one or more\r\n  license matches in a larger license detection. This approach improves the\r\n  accuracy of license detection and removes a larger number of false positive\r\n  or ambiguous license detections. See for details\r\n  https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/2878\r\n\r\n- There is a new ``license_detections`` codebase level attribute with all the\r\n  unique license detections in the whole scan, both in resources and packages.\r\n  This has the 3 attributes also present in package/resource level license\r\n  detections: ``license_expression``, ``matches`` and ``detection_log`` and has\r\n  two additional attributes:\r\n\r\n  - ``identifier``: which is the ``license_expression`` with an UUID created out\r\n    of the detection contents and is the same for same detections.\r\n\r\n  - ``count``: Number of times in the codebase this unique license detection\r\n    was encountered.\r\n\r\n- The data structure of the JSON output has changed for licenses at file level:\r\n\r\n  - The ``licenses`` attribute is deleted.\r\n\r\n  - A new ``for_license_detections`` attribute is aded which references the codebase\r\n    level unique license detections, and this is a list of ``identifer`` strings from\r\n    the codebase level license detections it references.\r\n  \r\n  - A new ``license_detections`` attribute contains license detections in that file.\r\n    This object has three attributes: ``license_expression``, ``detection_log``\r\n    and ``matches``. ``matches`` is a list of license matches and is roughly\r\n    the same as  ``licenses`` in the previous version with additional structure\r\n    changes detailed below.\r\n\r\n  - A new attribute ``license_clues`` contains license matches with the\r\n    same data structure as the ``matches`` attribute in ``license_detections``.\r\n    This contains license matches that are mere clues and where not considered\r\n    to be a proper conclusive license detection.\r\n\r\n  - The ``license_expressions`` list of license expressions is deleted and\r\n    replaced by a ``detected_license_expression`` single expression.\r\n    Similarly ``spdx_license_expressions`` was removed and replaced by\r\n    ``detected_license_expression_spdx``.\r\n\r\n  - See `license updates documentation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/license-detection-reference.html#change-in-license-data-format-resource>`_\r\n    for examples and details.\r\n\r\n- The data structure of license attributes in ``package_data`` and the codebase\r\n  level ``packages`` has been updated accordingly:\r\n\r\n  - There is a new ``license_detections`` attribute for the primary, top-level\r\n    declared licenses of a package and an ``other_license_detections`` attribute\r\n    for the other secondary detections.\r\n\r\n  - The ``license_expression`` is replaced by the ``declared_license_expression``\r\n    and ``other_license_expression`` attributes with their SPDX counterparts\r\n    ``declared_license_expression_spdx`` and ``other_license_expression_spdx``.\r\n    These expressions are parallel to detections.\r\n\r\n  - The ``declared_license`` attribute is renamed ``extracted_license_statement``\r\n    and is now a YAML-encoded string.\r\n\r\n    See `license updates documentation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/license-detection-reference.html#change-in-license-data-format-package>`_\r\n    for examples and details.\r\n\r\n- The license matches structure has changed: we used to report one match for each\r\n  license ``key`` of a matched license expression. We now report instead one\r\n  single match for each matched license expression, and list the license keys\r\n  as a ``licenses`` attribute. This avoids data duplication.\r\n  Inside each match, we list each match and matched rule attributred directly\r\n  avoiding nesting. See `license updates doc <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/license-detection-reference.html#licensematch-result-data>`_\r\n  for examples and details.\r\n\r\n- There are new and codebase level attributes default with `--licenses` to report\r\n  reference license metadata and texts once for each license matched across the\r\n  scan; we now have two codebase level attributes: ``license_references`` and\r\n  ``license_rule_references`` that list unique detected license and license rules.\r\n  for examples and details. This reference data is also removed from license matches\r\n  in all levels i.e. from codebase, package and resource level license detections and\r\n  resource level license clues.\r\n  See `license updates documentation <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/explanations/license-detection-reference.html#comparision-before-after-license-references>`_\r\n\r\n- We replaced the ``scancode --reindex-licenses`` command line option with a\r\n  new separate command named ``scancode-reindex-licenses``.\r\n\r\n  - The ``--reindex-licenses-for-all-languages`` CLI option is also moved to\r\n    the ``scancode-reindex-licenses`` command as an option ``--all-languages``.\r\n\r\n  - We can now detect licenses using custom license texts and license rules\r\n    stored in a directory or packaged as a plugin for consistent reuse and deployment.\r\n  \r\n  - There is an ``--additional-directory`` option with the ``scancode-reindex-licenses``\r\n    command to add the licenses from a directory.\r\n    \r\n  - There is also a ``--only-builtin`` option to use ony builtin licenses\r\n    ignoring any additional license plugins.\r\n\r\n  - See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/480 for more details.\r\n\r\n- We combined the licensedata file and text file of each license in a single\r\n  file with a .LICENSE extension. The .yml data file is now included at the\r\n  top of each .LICENSE file as \"YAML frontmatter\". The same applies to license\r\n  rules and their .RULE and .yml files. This halves the number of data files\r\n  from about 60,000 to 30,000. Git line history is preserved for the combined\r\n   text + yml files.\r\n\r\n  - See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3049\r\n\r\n- There is a new console script ``scancode-license-data`` to export\r\n  license data in JSON, YAML and HTML, with indexes and a static website for use\r\n  in the licensedb web site. This becomes the  API way to getr scancode license\r\n  data.\r\n\r\n  See https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/2738\r\n\r\n- The deprecated \"--is-license-text\" option has been removed.\r\n  This is now built-in with the --license-text option and --info\r\n  and exposed with the \"percentage_of_license_text\" attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## All Changes\r\n* Add support for external licenses in scans by @KevinJi22 in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/2979\r\n* Separate Package parsing functions by @JonoYang in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3135\r\n* Update docs for deprecated and other options #3126 by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3127\r\n* Add license dump option by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3100\r\n* Combine license matches in new LicenseDetection by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/2961\r\n* Fix issue 3155 by running `scancode-reindex-licenses` subcommand instead of using `--reindex-licenses` flag by @abhi-kr-2100 in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3159\r\n* Detect wurfl commercial license by @pombredanne in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3163\r\n* Do not use packaging.LegacyVersion #3171 #3177 by @pombredanne in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3180\r\n* More License Detection changes by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3154\r\n* docs(fix): how to install Py. 3.8 on recent Ubuntu by @camillem in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3146\r\n* Add links to basic options in docs by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3142\r\n* install.rst: spelling by @vargenau in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3184\r\n* Release 32.0.0rc1 prep by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3150\r\n* Remove deprecated images from CI and release-script by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3099\r\n* Fix unhashable type error in cyclonedx #3016 by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3189\r\n* Update license db generation by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3197\r\n* Remove license text from index.json of licenseDB by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3201\r\n* Support python 3.11 by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3199\r\n* Properly assign boolean to is_resolved #3152 by @JonoYang in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3153\r\n* Vendor attrs to avoid unpickle issues #3179 #3192 by @pombredanne in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3193\r\n* Remove trailing T in date by @pombredanne in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3203\r\n* Restore help.html from nexB/scancode-licensedb#23 by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3202\r\n* adapt code to new spdx-tools release by @meretp in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3173\r\n* Add nuget nuspec dependencies by @pombredanne in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3206\r\n* Fix release scripts by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3208\r\n* Fix attrs version in requirements by @AyanSinhaMahapatra in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3209\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @abhi-kr-2100 made their first contribution in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3159\r\n* @camillem made their first contribution in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3146\r\n* @vargenau made their first contribution in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3184\r\n* @meretp made their first contribution in https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/pull/3173\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/compare/v31.2.4...v32.0.0rc1",

        "body": "This is a major release with important bug and security fixes, new and improved\r\nfeatures and API changes.\r\n\r\nNote that we no longer support Python 3.6. Use Python 3.7+ instead.\r\n\r\n\r\nImportant API changes:\r\n========================\r\n\r\n- The data structure of the JSON output has changed for copyrights, authors\r\n  and holders. We now use a proper name for attributes and not a generic \"value\".\r\n\r\n- The data structure of the JSON output has changed for packages. We now\r\n  return \"package_data\" package information at the manifest file-level\r\n  rather than \"packages\". This has all the data attributes of a \"package_data\"\r\n  field plus others: \"package_uuid\", \"package_data_files\" and \"files\".\r\n\r\n  - There is a a new top-level \"packages\" attribute that contains package\r\n    instances that can be aggregating data from multiple manifests.\r\n\r\n  - There is a a new top-level \"dependencies\" attribute that contains each\r\n    dependency instance, these can be standalone or releated to a package.\r\n    These contain a new \"extra_data\" object.\r\n\r\n  - There is a new resource-level attribute \"for_packages\" which refers to\r\n    packages through package_uuids (pURL + uuid string).\r\n\r\n- The data structure for HTML output has been changed to include emails and\r\n  urls under the  \"infos\" object. The HTML template displays output for holders,\r\n  authors, emails, and urls into separate tables like \"licenses\" and \"copyrights\".\r\n\r\n- The data structure for CSV output has been changed to rename the Resource\r\n  column to \"path\". \"copyright_holder\" has been renamed to \"holder\". The CSV\r\n  output is deprecated and will be replaced in the future by an improved tabular\r\n  format.\r\n\r\n- The license clarity scoring plugin has been overhauled to show new license\r\n  clarity criteria. More details of the new scoring criteria are provided below.\r\n\r\n- The functionality of the summary plugin has been imprived to provide declared\r\n  origin and license information for the codebase being scanned. The previous\r\n  summary plugin functionality has been preserved in the new ``tallies`` plugin.\r\n  More details are provided below.\r\n\r\n- ScanCode has adopted the new code skeleton from https://github.com/nexB/skeleton\r\n  The key change is the location of the virtual environment. It used to be\r\n  created at the root of the scancode-toolkit directory. It is now created\r\n  under the ``venv`` subdirectory. You mus be aware of this if you use ScanCode\r\n  from a git clone\r\n\r\n- ``DatafileHandler.assemble()``, ``DatafileHandler.assemble_from_many()``, and\r\n  the other ``.assemble()`` methods from the other Package handlers from\r\n  packagedcode, have been updated to yield Package items before Dependency or\r\n  Resource items. This is particulary important in the case where we are calling\r\n  the ``assemble()`` method outside of the scancode-toolkit context, where we\r\n  need to ensure that a Package exists before we assocate a Resource or\r\n  Dependency to it.\r\n\r\nCopyright detection:\r\n====================\r\n\r\n- The data structure in the JSON is now using consistently named attributes as\r\n  opposed to plain values.\r\n- Several copyright detection bugs have been fixed.\r\n- French and German copyright detection is improved.\r\n- Some spurious trailing dots in holders are not stripped.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense detection:\r\n===================\r\n\r\n- There have been significant license detection rules and licenses updates:\r\n\r\n  - 107 new licenses have been added (total is now 1954)\r\n  - 6780 new license detection rules have been added (total is now 32259)\r\n  - 6753 existing false positive license rules have been removed (see below).\r\n  - The SPDX license list has been updated to the latest v3.17\r\n\r\n- The rule attribute \"only_known_words\" has been renamed to \"is_continuous\" and its\r\n  meaning has been updated and expanded. A rule tagged as \"is_continuous\" can only\r\n  be matched if there are no gaps between matched words, be they stopwords, extra\r\n  unknown or known words. This improves several false positive license detections.\r\n  The processing for \"is_continous\" has been merged in \"key phrases\" processing\r\n  below.\r\n\r\n- Key phrases can now be defined in a RULE text by surrounding one or more words\r\n  with double curly braces `{{` and `}}`. When defined a RULE will only match\r\n  when the key phrases match exactly. When all the text of rule is a \"key phrase\",\r\n  this is the same as being \"is_continuous\".\r\n\r\n- The \"--unknown-licenses\" option now also detects unknown licenses using a\r\n  simple and effective ngrams-based matching in area that are not matched or\r\n  weakly matched. This helps detects things that look like a license but are not\r\n  yet known as licenses.\r\n\r\n- False positive detection of \"license lists\" like the lists seen in license and\r\n  package management tools has been entirely reworked. Rather than using\r\n  thousands of small false positive rules, there is a new filter to detect a\r\n  long run of license references and tags that is typical of license lists.\r\n  As a results, thousands of rules have been replaced by a simpler filter, and\r\n  the license detection is more accurate, faster and has fewer false\r\n  positives.\r\n\r\n- The new license flag \"is_generic\" tags licenses that are \"generic\" licenses\r\n  such as \"other-permissive\" or \"other-copyleft\". This is not yet\r\n  returned in the JSON API.\r\n\r\n- When scanning binary files, the detection of single word rules is filtered when\r\n  surrounded by gibberish or mixed case. For instance `$#%$GpL$` is a false\r\n  positive and is no longer reported.\r\n\r\n- Several rules we tagged as is_license_notice incorrectly but were references\r\n  and have been requalified as is_license_reference. All rules made of a single\r\n  ord have been requalified as is_license_reference if they were not qualified\r\n  this way.\r\n\r\n- Matches to small license rules (with small defined as under 15 words)\r\n  that are scattered over too many lines are now filtered as false matches.\r\n\r\n- Small, two-words matches that overlap the previous or next match by\r\n  by the word \"license\" and assimilated are now filtered as false matches.\r\n\r\n- The new --licenses-reference option adds a new \"licenses_reference\" top\r\n  level attribute to a scan when using the JSON and YAML outputs. This contains\r\n  all the details and the full text of every license seen in a file or\r\n  package license expression of a scan. This can be added added after the fact\r\n  using the --from-json option.\r\n\r\n- New experimental support for non-English licenses. Use the command\r\n  ./scancode --reindex-licenses-for-all-languages to index all known non-English\r\n  licenses and rules. From that point on, they will be detected. Because of this\r\n  some licenses that were not tagged with their languages are now correctly\r\n  tagged and they may not be detected unless you activate this new indexing\r\n  feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nPackage detection:\r\n==================\r\n\r\n- Major changes in package detection and reporting, codebase-level attribute `packages`\r\n  with one or more `package_data` and files for the packages are reported.\r\n  The specific changes made are:\r\n\r\n  - The resource level attribute `packages` has been renamed to `package_data`,\r\n    as these are really package data that are being detected, such as manifests,\r\n    lockfiles or other package data. This has the data attributes of a `package_data`\r\n    field plus others: `package_uuid`, `package_data_files` and `files`.\r\n\r\n  - A new top-level attribute `packages` has been added which contains package\r\n    instances created from `package_data` detected in the codebase.\r\n\r\n  - A new codebase level attribute `dependencies` has been added which contains dependency\r\n    instances created from lockfiles detected in the codebase.\r\n\r\n  - The package attribute `root_path` has been deleted from `package_data` in favour\r\n    of the new format where there is no root conceptually, just a list of files for each\r\n    package.\r\n\r\n  - There is a new resource-level attribute `for_packages` which refers to\r\n    packages through package_uids (pURL + uuid string). A `package_adder`\r\n    function is now used to associate a Package to a Resource that is part of\r\n    it. This gives us the flexibility to use the packagedcode Package handlers\r\n    in other contexts where `for_packages` on Resource is not implemented in the\r\n    same way as scancode-toolkit.\r\n\r\n  - The package_data attribute `dependencies` (which is a list of DependentPackages),\r\n    now has a new attribute `resolved_package` with a package data mapping.\r\n    Also the `requirement` attribute is renamed to `extracted_requirement`.\r\n    There is a new `extra_data` to collect extra data as needed.\r\n\r\n- For Pypi packages, python_requires is treated as a package dependency.\r\n\r\n\r\nLicense Clarity Scoring Update:\r\n===============================\r\n\r\n- We are moving away from the original license clarity scoring designed for\r\n  ClearlyDefined in the license clarity score plugin. The previous license\r\n  clarity scoring logic produced a score that was misleading when it would\r\n  return a low score due to the stringent scoring criteria. We are now using\r\n  more general criteria to get a sense of what provenance information has been\r\n  provided and whether or not there is a conflict in licensing between what\r\n  licenses were declared at the top-level key files and what licenses have been\r\n  detected in the files under the top-level.\r\n\r\n- The license clarity score is a value from 0-100 calculated by combining the\r\n  weighted values determined for each of the scoring elements:\r\n\r\n  - Declared license:\r\n\r\n    - When true, indicates that the software package licensing is documented at\r\n      top-level or well-known locations in the software project, typically in a\r\n      package manifest, NOTICE, LICENSE, COPYING or README file.\r\n    - Scoring Weight = 40\r\n\r\n  - Identification precision:\r\n\r\n    - Indicates how well the license statement(s) of the software identify known\r\n      licenses that can be designated by precise keys (identifiers) as provided in\r\n      a publicly available license list, such as the ScanCode LicenseDB, the SPDX\r\n      license list, the OSI license list, or a URL pointing to a specific license\r\n      text in a project or organization website.\r\n    - Scoring Weight = 40\r\n\r\n  - License texts:\r\n\r\n    - License texts are provided to support the declared license expression in\r\n      files such as a package manifest, NOTICE, LICENSE, COPYING or README.\r\n    - Scoring Weight = 10\r\n\r\n  - Declared copyright:\r\n\r\n    - When true, indicates that the software package copyright is documented at\r\n      top-level or well-known locations in the software project, typically in a\r\n      package manifest, NOTICE, LICENSE, COPYING or README file.\r\n    - Scoring Weight = 10\r\n\r\n  - Ambiguous compound licensing:\r\n\r\n    - When true, indicates that the software has a license declaration that\r\n      makes it difficult to construct a reliable license expression, such as in\r\n      the case of multiple licenses where the conjunctive versus disjunctive\r\n      relationship is not well defined.\r\n    - Scoring Weight = -10\r\n\r\n  - Conflicting license categories:\r\n\r\n    - When true, indicates that the declared license expression of the software\r\n      is in the permissive category, but that other potentially conflicting\r\n      categories, such as copyleft and proprietary, have been detected in lower\r\n      level code.\r\n    - Scoring Weight = -20\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary Plugin Update:\r\n======================\r\n\r\n- The summary plugin's behavior has been changed. Previously, it provided a\r\n  count of the detected license expressions, copyrights, holders, authors, and\r\n  programming languages from a scan.\r\n\r\n  We have preserved this functionality by creating a new plugin called ``tallies``.\r\n  All functionality of the previous summary plugin have been preserved in the\r\n  tallies plugin.\r\n\r\n- The new summary plugin now attempts to determine a declared license expression,\r\n  declared holder, and the primary programming language from a scan. And the\r\n  updated license clarity score provides context on the quality  of the license\r\n  information provided in the codebase key files.\r\n\r\n- The new summary plugin also returns lists of tallies for the other \"secondary\"\r\n  detected license expressions, copyright holders, and programming languages.\r\n\r\nAll summary information is provided at the codebase-level attribute named ``summary``.\r\n\r\n\r\nOutputs:\r\n========\r\n\r\n- Added new outputs for the CycloneDx format.\r\n  The CLI now exposes options to produce CycloneDx BOMs in either JSON or XML format\r\n\r\n- A new field ``warnings`` has been added to the headers of ScanCode toolkit output\r\n  that contains any warning messages that occur during a scan.\r\n\r\n- The CSV output format --csv option is now deprecated. It will be replaced by\r\n  new CSV and tabular output formats in the next ScanCode release.\r\n  Visit https://github.com/nexB/scancode-toolkit/issues/3043 to provide inputs\r\n  and feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\nOutput version\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nScancode Data Output Version is now 2.0.0.\r\n\r\n\r\nChanges:\r\n\r\n- Rename resource level attribute `packages` to `package_data`.\r\n- Add top-level attribute `packages`.\r\n- Add top-level attribute `dependencies`.\r\n- Add resource-level attribute `for_packages`.\r\n- Remove `package-data` attribute `root_path`.\r\n- The fields of the license clarity scoring plugin have been replaced with the\r\n  following fields. An overview of the new fields can be found in the \"License\r\n  Clarity Scoring Update\" section above.\r\n\r\n    - `score`\r\n    - `declared_license`\r\n    - `identification_precision`\r\n    - `has_license_text`\r\n    - `declared_copyrights`\r\n    - `conflicting_license_categories`\r\n    - `ambigious_compound_licensing`\r\n\r\n- The fields of the summary plugin have been replaced with the following fields.\r\n  An overview of the new fields can be found in the \"Summary Plugin Update\"\r\n  section above.\r\n\r\n    - `declared_license_expression`\r\n    - `license_clarity_score`\r\n    - `declared_holder`\r\n    - `primary_language`\r\n    - `other_license_expressions`\r\n    - `other_holders`\r\n    - `other_languages`\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation Update\r\n========================\r\n\r\n- Various documentation files have been updated to reflects API changes and\r\n  correct minor documentation issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment environment and Code API changes:\r\n==============================================\r\n\r\n- The main package API function `get_package_infos` is deprecated, and\r\n  replaced by `get_package_data`.\r\n\r\n- The Resources path are always the same regardless of the strip-root or\r\n  full-root arguments.\r\n\r\n- The license cache consistency is not checked anymore when you are using a git\r\n  checkout. The SCANCODE_DEV_MODE tag file has been removed entirely. Use\r\n  instead the --reindex-licenses option to rebuild the license index.\r\n\r\n- We can now regenerate test fixtures using the new SCANCODE_REGEN_TEST_FIXTURES\r\n  environment variable. There is no need to replace the regen=False with\r\n  regen=True in the code.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous\r\n========================\r\n\r\n- Added support for usage of shortcut flags\r\n  - `-A` or `--about`\r\n  - `-q` or `--quiet`\r\n  - `-v` or `--verbose`\r\n  - `-V` or `--version` can be used.\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Report `packages` at top level with file level `package_manifests`

        "body": "This is a major release with new features, and several bug fixes and\r\nimprovements including major updates to the license detection.\r\n\r\nWe have dropped using calendar-based versions and are now switched back to semver\r\nversioning. To ensure that there is no ambiguity, the new major version has been\r\nupdated from 21 to 30. The primary reason is that calver was not helping\r\nintegrators to track major version changes like semver does.\r\n\r\nWe also have introduced a new JSON output format version based on semver to\r\nversion the JSON output format data structure and have documented the new\r\nversioning approach.\r\n\r\nHere are the key changes for each area:\r\n\r\n## Package detection:\r\n\r\n- The Debian packages declared license detection in machine readable copyright\r\n  files and unstructured copyright has been significantly improved with the\r\n  tracking of the detection start and end line of a license match. This is not\r\n  yet exposed outside of tests but has been essential to help improve detection.\r\n\r\n- Debian copyright license detection has been significantly improved with new\r\n  license detection rules.\r\n\r\n- Support for Windows packages has been improved (and in particular the handling\r\n  of Windows packages detection in the Windows registry).\r\n\r\n- Support for Cocoapod packages has been significantly revamped and is now\r\n  working as expected.\r\n\r\n- Support for PyPI packages has been refined, in particular package descriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright detection:\r\n\r\n- The copyright detection accuracy has been improved and several bugs have been\r\n  fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License detection:\r\n\r\nThere have been some significant updates in license detection. We now track\r\n34,164 license and license notices:\r\n\r\n  - 84 new licenses have been added, \r\n  - 34 existing license metadata have been updated,\r\n  - 2765 new license detection rules have been added, and\r\n  - 2041 existing license rules have been updated.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Several license detection bugs have fixed.\r\n\r\n- The SPDX license list 3.14 is now supported and has been synced with the\r\n  licensedb. We also include the version of the SPDX license list in the\r\n  ScanCode YAML, JSON and the SPDX outputs, as well as display it with the\r\n  \"--version\" command line option.\r\n\r\n- Unknown licenses have a new flag \"is_unknown\" in their metadata to identify\r\n  them explicitly. Before that we were just relying on the naming convention of\r\n  having \"unknown\" as part of a license key.\r\n\r\n- Rules that match at least one unknown license have a flag \"has_unknown\" set\r\n  and returned in the match results.\r\n\r\n- Experimental: License detection can now \"follow\" license mentions that\r\n  reference another file such as \"see license in COPYING\" where we can relate\r\n  this mention to the actual license detected in the COPYING file. Use the new\r\n  \"--unknown-licenses\" command line option to test this new feature.\r\n  This feature will evolve significantly in the next version(s).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Outputs:\r\n\r\n- The SPDX output now has the mandatory ids attribute per SPDX spec. And we\r\n  support SPDX 2.2 and SPDX license list 3.14.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Miscellaneous\r\n\r\n- There is a new \"--no-check-version\" CLI option to scancode to bypass live,\r\n  remote outdated version check on PyPI\r\n\r\n- The scan results and the CLI now display an outdated version warning when\r\n  the installed ScanCode version is older than 90 days. This is to warn users\r\n  that they are relying on outdated, likely buggy, insecure and inaccurate scan\r\n  results and encourage them to update to a newer version. This is made entirely\r\n  locally based on date comparisons.\r\n\r\n- We now display again the command line progressbar counters correctly.\r\n\r\n- A bug has been fixed in summarization.\r\n\r\n- Generated code detection has been improved with several new keywords.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Thank you!\r\n\r\nMany thanks to the many contributors that made this release possible and in\r\nparticular:\r\n\r\n- Akanksha Garg @akugarg\r\n- Armijn Hemel @armijnhemel \r\n- Ayan Sinha Mahapatra @AyanSinhaMahapatra\r\n- Bryan Sutula @sutula\r\n- Chin-Yeung Li @chinyeungli\r\n- Dennis Clark @DennisClark\r\n- dyh @yunhua-deng\r\n- Dr. Frank Heimes @FrankHeimes \r\n- gunaztar @gunaztar\r\n- Helio Chissini de Castro @heliocastro\r\n- Henrik Sandklef @hesa\r\n- Jiyeong Seok @dd-jy\r\n- John M.
